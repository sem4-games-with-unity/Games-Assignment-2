# Games-Assignment-2

## Green

1. Use Unity Standard Assets library to make the following games:
2. A flight simulator, where the player must pick up powerups in the air, a sound is played when that happens. A
counter in the UI shows how many powerups has been picked up. Make sure the camera follows the plane.
Hint: There is an “AircraftJet” prefab in Standard assets -> Vehicles -> Aircraft folder.
3. Make a car stunt game. Again you can find a prefab in the standard assets. Make a nice track or sandbox
where the player can drive around – there must be ramps to fly into the air. There must be a reset button in
case the player car ends upside down
4. Make a third person shooter, use standard asset prefabs. The player must be able to walk around and shoot
at enemies. Enemies doesn’t have to move around or be intelligent or shoot back at the player, but enemies
must explode when they die.
5. In order to save memory, make sure the bullets disappear after some time, for example by calling Destroy or
by using a pool of bullets
6. Prep your project for GIT and upload to Github. paste URL here:
